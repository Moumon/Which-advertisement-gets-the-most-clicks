# Which-advertisement-gets-the-most-clicks

Our marketing team prepared 10 ads, which are on the brand new SUV. All the ads have different designs. The advertising team needs to know which ad will result in most no. of clicksby the user.

The problem is that we cannot do this process of showing the ads to the consumer realtime and take in the data. It would be costly and it would deceive the user, which we do not want. So we need a simulation which is what our dataset is doing.

Each row corresponds to a single customer, whom we showed the 10 ads and recorded their observation. Each users, will be taken as a round and imagine this as a dynamic dataset.

As we show it to more and mre customers, our cost keeps on increasing so, we need to determine the best ad as soon as possible and then exploit it.
